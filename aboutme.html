                <p class="textheader1">I am webmaster with 13 years of experience in designing and developing software. Currently living with my family in United Kingdom.

My journey started as a developer in 2006, purely out of curiosity. On my path I visited and explored multitude of technologies and tools. Quite lot of them are relic now. So.. clear still learning.  
 
But this is exactly what had made the journey interesting. On every corner new valley's insight and mountains to challenges to conquer.
